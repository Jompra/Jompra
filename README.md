### Hi, I'm George. A Junior Full Stack developer in London, UK

I'm currently a Site Reliability Engineer with the incredible team at Dunelm.

I'm currently learning AWS for work, and Golang for me.

Take a look at my personal website [georgekeesjones.com](https://georgekeesjones.com)

Or ping me an email [georgekeesjones@gmail.com](mailto:georgekeesjones@gmail.com?subject=Hey,%20I%20found%20your%20profile%20on%20GitHub...)

I've got the below AWS Certs and I plan to study for and complete all Associate and Professional Certs.
