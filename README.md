### Hi, I'm George. A Site Reliability Engineer in London, UK

I'm currently working with the incredible team at Utility Warehouse.

At the moment I'm learning all about the exciting world of Kubernetes.

Take a look at my personal website [georgekeesjones.com](https://georgekeesjones.com) Although it's probably a bit out of date.

Or ping me an email [georgekeesjones@gmail.com](mailto:georgekeesjones@gmail.com?subject=Hey,%20I%20found%20your%20profile%20on%20GitHub...) although I get a bout a million automated recruiter emails here so I might take a couple of days to get back to you.

I'm also on LinkedIn [@georgekjones](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgekjones/)

I've got the below AWS Certs and when I get the time I'll get the Professional Certs too.
